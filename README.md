This is an example of a simple binary classification based on the resnet50 model. 
The val folder contains pictures of "bing" and "zu". 
At the same time, I also uploaded the model file of the initial training for your convenience. 
I hope you can repeat it successfully. Thank you for subscribing!
Unfortunately, because the model file is too large to upload, you will need to train your model based on the data set I provided.

这是基于resnet50模型的一个简单二分类示例。val文件夹里面有“兵”和“卒”两种类别的图片。
同时我还上传了初次训练的模型文件，方便各位使用。希望你能成功复现。最后感谢您的订阅！
很抱歉，由于模型文件太大无法上传，各位需要根据我提供的数据集自己训练一个模型。
