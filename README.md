This is an example of a simple binary classification based on the resnet50 model. 
The val folder contains pictures of "bing" and "zu". 
At the same time, I also uploaded the model file of the initial training for your convenience. 
I hope you can repeat it successfully. Thank you for subscribing!
Unfortunately, because the model file is too large to upload, you will need to train your model based on the data set I provided.
